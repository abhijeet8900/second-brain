### Savings Bucket  [**Savings ( 20% )**](https://www.notion.so/Savings-20-992f3a4e0ab7431b9570b85933dfe484?pvs=21)

- We want to have a bucket for emergency funds and savings. Ideally, both should be different but not much of a difference in reason.
    - An unforeseen event can be handled.
    - Don’t have to rely on monthly income to survive.
    - This account will have regular monthly deposits but no withdrawals.
    - Will get a debit card and checkbook for emergencies.
    - In the future, this bucket will act as a personal bank once enough money is saved.
    - The rule will be other buckets can borrow money from this bucket and have to repay it as EMI, Improvement on this will be to charge interest.
    - In the future, this account will have long-term investment EMIs to make sure we don’t have to stress about those.
    - This account will be responsible for investment as well. As a start, we will plan to invest 30% of saving bucket funds each month

### Needs Bucket  [**Needs ( 50% )**](https://www.notion.so/Needs-50-b65a1557e54340c79542eaa15618cf41?pvs=21)

- We want a bucket that will be responsible for regular bills and responsible for monthly survival.
    - Makes sure that all my monthly bills are paid and I don’t have to worry about anything till next month.
    - This bucket will have UPI and a credit card.
    - This will be responsible for paying all monthly bills through UPI or bank transfer.
    - It will also have small RD’s to save for yearly bills eg. iWish for ICICI

### Wants Bucket [**Wants ( 30% )**](https://www.notion.so/Wants-30-1554b59d7bcf4740833794e3637ea02d?pvs=21)

- We want to have an expense account, this bucket will be an account from which we can spend.
    - Make sure I have money to spend each day of the month.
    - It will be linked to UPI for ease of use.
    - Money will be limited to a certain amount each month anything more will be treated as an extra expense. Can be taken from other buckets. Repayment to these buckets will be done next month or as EMI for a few months.
    - Will not have a credit card
    - Will have a debit card.
    - Will be responsible for paying credit card bills.

## Money Divide Plan

![Untitled](Finance%20Plan%202024%2041833a51b5d249d5a8776af628ac5ba0/Untitled%201.png)

## Buying things :

- Ideally, we will be buying things from the money we get in the wants bucket. Even if we buy it using EMI it will be paid through the wants bucket each month.
- If we buy a thing that exceeds the want bucket limit, we will take it from needs ( credit card ideally ).
- This money needs to be returned to the need account by the want account as EMI over the next few months.
- Money will be cut when the salary account transfers money at the start of the month.
- The budget sheet needs to count for this setup.
- There will be allowance for regular things where we use credit card

```jsx
Eg: 
Monthly Wants is 10K
Brought Phone worth 50K
Paid 20K from the want account, borrowed 30K from Need Account  
For Next 6 months, Want Account will pay 5K to need Account
```

## Credit Card Bills

Credit cards will be used only for buying things which should be brought using a wants bucket. Wants Bucket will be responsible for paying credit card bills each month. For each month credit card bill will be paid using the want bucket amount for that month.

## **Account Flushing**

At the end of each month, 50% of the remaining balance in each account (except the savings account) will be transferred to the savings account. This will help in building up savings and ensure that some portion of the money is saved regularly.

1. Transfer 50% of the wants bucket remaining to the needs bucket 
2. Transfer 50% of the need bucket remaining to a savings bucket 

## Investments

The goal of investment is to create long-term investment assets. We would love to have investment assets that will provide us with dividends. 

For each month we will be getting some amount in the savings bucket. We want part of the money from this bucket to be invested. Ideally, we want to save 50% of the money coming each month into the bucket as an emergency fund, we can change this after having sufficient money as an emergency fund. Long term goal is to have 3-6 months of salary in emergency funds.

As for investment, we have the following options to invest into, 

- PPF will help us save tax but has a long maturity period.
- SIP ( Mutual funds ), More returns. I think should be a major investment.
- Gold Scheme ( PNG scheme ). We can invest in a small amount which will be cashed out end of each year ( after 11 months )
- Gold Bonds, Something we can plan to save for or just take money from a savings account at the time of buying bonds, This will allow us to invest money from emergency funds each year
- Stocks, This is something that needs more effort so we want to stay away from it for now, till we have a stable system

## Monthly Budget Sheet

The sheet should consist of guidelines for how much money we get in each bucket and how it's justified. Guideline/limit of monthly expenses. An important one is the needs bucket, after the needs bucket is satisfied we can split the money into savings and want buckets, where savings should be less but reasonable. Percentages of money divided will be calculated by following rules : 

- Want bracket amount will be calculated by the total of monthly bills + buffer amount.
- After that savings bucket amount will be calculated from the remaining amount. It will have at least the mentioned minimum amount or at max 30% of the remaining amount
- After that, wants bucket amount will be calculated as whatever is remaining.

This will make sure that, even if our salary amount for each month changes we will be paying monthly bills without any issues. Other buckets will account for that money. 

Things sheet should include : 

- How much do we need for monthly survival ( want bucket )? This will include a list of bills we are paying regularly.
- The amount of money that will go to the savings bucket after the want bucket.
- The amount of money we will get in the needs bucket.
- The sheet should help us with the following questions :
    - Which bucket is responsible for paying which bills?
    - How much money do we get for spending in a month?
- For the first few months, this sheet will be updated as needed. Eg if some bucket is getting more money than it needs.

## Summary

- The key to success is to have this account and use them as per their decided use cases, this will ensure some level of tracking for money spent.
- At the end of each month, 50% of leftover money from each account will be transferred to savings. This will help us to save & invest more money
- Every account will have some % buffer money.

## Accounts

- Salary Account: ICICI Account
- Savings Bucket: SBI Account

## Monthly Rituals

1. Record - Net income, CC bill, Remaining to each bucket.

    - If yes then transfer the cc bill amount to the salary account.
    - If not transfer all remaining to the salary account.
3. Calculate money to be transferred to each bucket from salary, using the percentage decided. For the want bucket, it will be credit card bill transfer + amount to be transferred this month.
4. Pay credit card bills using a salary account. Deduct it from the want bucket amount to be transferred.
5. Transfer 50% of the wants bucket into to needs bucket.
