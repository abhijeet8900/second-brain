- Spotify Dashboard : [https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
- Spotify Documentation : [https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/scopes#user-read-playback-state](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/scopes#user-read-playback-state)

- Mobile App
    - To use as slave and our server will be master, once connected we will have information about device
    - App will be server which will listen to api calls on mobile and do actions
    - App to call basic mobile commands like play, pause, next, previous.
    - Server can use registered or connected client to call actions, eg play all

Ideas :

- Write music player for youtube music
- Shutting all devices off using mobile
- Create master & slave version of script, client will be able to receive command from server
    - salve will give info about system, other details
    - we can do actions on slave using master or main server, eg shutdown.
    - Slave script might need extra steps for setup
    - Slave script will be depend on different OS
- Write shell, bash scripts to call API’s on each machine, eg status, isConnected
    
    

## Server / Client

### UI / Web / App :

### Server :

- Register client with there id’s and details which will be used to call them  ✅
- Server will have API’s for calling the action on client.
- This can be for all or for single client

### Client :

- Client will register to server with details about how to call them
- Client will receive commands from server eg. shut down
